# The Cache Problem of @latest

## @latest version is not updated for 12 hours without manual purge

The CDN caches files for 12 hours so that's the maximum time for new users to start getting the updated file if no manual purge is done.

So, all the following files can be out of date when a new version is published
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo@latest/path/file.js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo@latest/path/file.min.js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo/path/file.js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo/path/file.min.js
```

## @latest max-age is 7 days for browser cache

https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/issues/18121

This can be resolved by adding a suffix
```
Â file.js?t=135623457
```

## Purge API

There is a purge API available to use.

Examples (need all of them):
```
https://purge.jsdelivr.net/gh/prgwrtr/cdn@latest/app/sm2/js/mbuembed.js
https://purge.jsdelivr.net/gh/prgwrtr/cdn@latest/app/sm2/js/mbuembed.min.js
https://purge.jsdelivr.net/gh/prgwrtr/cdn/app/sm2/js/mbuembed.js
https://purge.jsdelivr.net/gh/prgwrtr/cdn/app/sm2/js/mbuembed.min.js
```
